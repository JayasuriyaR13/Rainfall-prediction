# Rainfall prediction using Machine Learning

- Built a machine learning model to predict rainfall using atmospheric data.
- Used Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost for data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.
- Achieved 85% accuracy with Support Vector Classifier (SVC) as the best-performing model.
- Improved predictions by balancing imbalanced datasets and optimizing features.
